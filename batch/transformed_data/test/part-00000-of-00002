But up foremost  I believe that If a man is willing to hit a female  whom is half the size  half the strength  half the fury  then the man is half of what a real man is. He's gotta make up for something else if he feels the need to take advantage of a being thats smaller and weaker that themselves or thier own. r r Hence don't think im not a feminist like all other strong figured  well headed  a female can do anything a man can do  but lets face reality and we can't. So when it comes down to it  theres nooo reason a male should ever hit another female. Ever."
